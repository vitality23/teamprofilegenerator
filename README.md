Hey there this is still a work in progress for me, but i decided to just put up what i have for now, right now i'm struggling with getting the office phone function to work and 
nothing yet is showing up on my html page so i will have to figure that out as well. I will also upload the pictures and videos required when i complete the full assignment, and also update the readme all the
way, just wanna keep this updated and posted. I only have 1 commit because I didn't open the repo right away, isntead i did it too late and never actually used it.
